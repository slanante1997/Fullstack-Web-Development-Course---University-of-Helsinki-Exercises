# Fullstack Web Development Course - University of Helsinki Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions and progress for the **[Fullstack Web Development Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)** offered by the [University of Helsinki](https://www.mooc.fi/fi/#programming). The course covers a comprehensive range of topics including _React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL,_ and _TypeScript,_ among others, providing a solid foundation for modern web development practices. All work can be found within seperate branches.

Please note that this repo is for reference purposes and to showcase my learning journey; it is not intended as a substitute for completing the coursework independently. Enjoy exploring my work and feel free to share any feedback or suggestions!
